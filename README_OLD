ABOUT

OhBoy is a Game-Boy/Game-Boy Color Emulator. Currently binaries are 
available for the GP2X Wiz. GP2X(F-xxx) and Pandora Support is planned. 

It is based on gnu-boy 1.0.3. The core sources have not been modified in
anyway but rather OhBoy provides a graphical front-end and GP2x-centric
back-end tailored for portable gaming.

OhBoy is currently beta software and has been somewhat rushed (along
with these docs) in time for Christmas but I hope you enjoy.


INSTALLATION

-GP2X WIZ
Extract all files and folders included in the archive onto your device.
No extra support files are required. The 'ohboy.gpe' script launches
the software and returns to the menu upon quitting. 'ohboy' is the
main executable.


USAGE

GP2X UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT: Gameboy D-Pad + Menu Navigation
GP2X START/MENU/HOME:    Gameboy 'Start' Button
GP2X SELECT:             Gameboy 'Select' Button
GP2X B:                  Gameboy 'A' button + Menu 'Select/OK' button
GP2X X:                  Gameboy 'B' button + Menu 'Back/Cancel' button
GP2X Y:                  Menu button (brings up the menu while playing a ROM)


LAUNCHER

-Load ROM
	Load and run a *.gb, *.gbc or *.zip ROM file.
-Options
	Brings up the global options editor. See OPTIONS for usage.
-Quit
	Exits the software.

MENU

-Back to Game
	Simply returns back to the game. Alternatively press the Back/Cancel button.
-Load ROM
	Load and run a *.gb, *.gbc or *.zip ROM file. To exit the ROM navigator 
	without loading a ROM press the Back/Cancel button. Press Select/OK to load
	the selected ROM.
-Load/Save State
	Load or save the current game state int a slot (up to 8 for any one game.)
	A save-state allows you to save the state of a game as-is for recall later.
	Save-states differ from a games usual save methods in that you can save or
	load at any time.
-Options
	See 'OPTIONS' for more info.
-Quit
	Quit the software. Recommended before switching off the device directly
	as any carts internal memory is saved at this point.

OPTIONS
	OhBoy's options are currently relatively basic. More reconfigurability is planned
	for future releases. Currently options are saved globally but I hope to
	include per-game support in the next major release.
-Mono Palette
	For non-color games, a selection of palettes.
-Color Filter
	Emulates the washed-out look of the Gameboy-color screens. Set to:
	-Off (no filtering)
	-On (Gameboy & Gameboy Color games are filtered)
	-GBC Only (Only Gameboy Color games are filtered)
-Upscaler
	Quality over quantity for this release :).
	-Sample1.5x:             Scales the display to 150% using grid-based
	                         pixel average up-sampling. (Quite fast.)
							 
	-Scale3x + Sample.75%:   Scales the display internally using the
	                         Scale3x algorithm which is a pixel-expansion
							 algorithm which enhances the look of the
							 original graphics. The result is down-sampled
							 using pixel averaging. (Not quite-so fast I
							 recommend upping the clock speed and/or 
							 frame-skip).
-Frameskip
	Some games will struggle to run at full-speed on the default/lower 
	clock speeds. Using frame skip will render every-other frame to allow
	the logic and sound emulation to run real-time at the cost of lower 
	FPS.
	- Auto: Will automatically skip frames if the game starts struggling.
	- Off:  Turns frame-skip off.
	- 1-4:  Fixed frame skip. Skips frames at regular intervals.
-Clock Speed
	The clock speed can be increased to increase performance of games that
	require greater-than typical processing power. This is at the cost
	of battery life. Frame-skip can be used as an alternative.
-ROM Path
	Sets the default path to search when loading ROMs.
-Apply
	Applies the above settings without saving (will be lost when quitting the
	emulator.)
-Save
	Applies the settings and saves them. When you next run OhBoy these settings
	will be automatically loaded. OhBoy does not currently support per-game
	saves.
